                                    <p>My name is Ebony Fellman and I am a 40-year-old Colorado native. I have been married for 18 years and I have two teenage children. 
                                        I mention that first, because I feel as though all my accomplishments have been driven by my family. I am very proud of my children. 
                                        My son is a wrestler and has a brown belt in martial arts. My daughter is an excellent dancer, and watching her dance is one of my favorite 
                                        past times.

                                        Most of my professional life has been spent in the technical support of clients and their software. I really enjoy troubleshooting and solving 
                                        technical problems, and a few of my jobs have even included reading and updating code.
                                            
                                        On a more personal note, I have many diverse interests and hobbies. I am a huge fan of the Food Network Channel and I love cooking different 
                                        and interesting meals. This is probably because I enjoy eating different types of food. I am a fan of art and this summer I will be making a 
                                        special visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, during a trip to New York. I am very much looking forward to it. I call myself a Podcast 
                                        junkie because of my enthusiasm listening to podcasts during my commutes to and from work. I like topics ranging from the mysterious and 
                                        bizarre, to crime documentaries, politics, science, and TED talks. Finally, I have very eclectic tastes in music. I would say that music 
                                        is one of my prime motivating factors.</p>
